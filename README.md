# Introduction

Hi,

This simple project is the very first thing I created and is the reason why I started to get into coding.

This quick project was produced following a video from Skillshare, then later modified to my own taste.
It was created in visual studio and later copied over to github so I can showcase it. 

I've used Code Institute's template to create this version.
